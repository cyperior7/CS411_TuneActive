## What's it about?
Tune Active is an app meant to make your workouts more about exercising and less about fussing with your music on your phone.

On our app, you will be able to connect to your Spotify account and mark songs as specific tags. These tags can be things like high intensity, low intensity, etc. It means that the song you selected as high intensity will only play when you are in the part of your workout that is the high intensity part.

Once you have marked your songs, you can head over to the Generate Playlist tab to generate a playlist. Here, you can add sliders indicating the amount of minutes for a specific part of your exercise routine. Then, upon pressing Generate, we will prepare a playlist where the first X minutes are whatever tag you selected on your first slider, the next Y minutes are whatever you selected for the second slider, etc. Then, all you have to do is press Play.

It should be noted that we create a playlist on your spotify account to hold these songs, so you can also generate the playlist at home and then go do your exercise using the Spotify app and finding the "TuneActive Playlist".

We have also created a Weather tab to check the weather of any city, and we'll provide you with our recommendation on whether or not you should go outside and exercise.

## App Use
* Upon entering our site, you will be prompted to login through Spotify and authorize our app access
* On successful login, use either the large button or the top tab at the top to go to the Manage Tags page
* Here, you will search songs and you can also give the number of results you want. You can then check the checkboxes next to the songs that you will be tagging for one particular tag.
* Scroll to the bottom, select the tag in the dropdown, and click the button Add Songs.
* After you've added many songs with corresponding tags to our backend database, head over to the Create Playlist tab.
* Here, add sliders for each part of your workout with a corresponding length and tag.
* Then, click the Generate button at the bottom to create your playlist and give you a Spotify player. You can also head over to your own Spotify account where you will see the playlist we generate.
* Additionally, if unsure of the weather and want a recommendation on whether or not to go outside, check out the Weather tab and enter your city for guidance.
